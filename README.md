## Week1 
- Please go to file Week1&Week2.txt. The objective of the exercise is to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. *In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...etc* Ref Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

## Week2 
- exercise is also contained in file Week1&Week2.txt. Student is required to change the string variable in code from tutorial to contain own surname, and rerun it. Function ord() returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character.

## Week3 
- exercise submission is in file Week3.py and is focused on the Collatz conjecture. *The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.* Ref Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture. Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement.

## Week4 
- exercise is in file Week4_Euler.py. *Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer, who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics. Problem 5 from project Euler is laid out as follows. 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.* Student is required to write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. Add your answer to your GitHub repository.

## Week5 
- excercise is contaned in Week5_Iris.py. Student is required to write a script that reads the Iris data set in 
and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. 

## Week6

- Python exercise is detailed in file Week6_Factorial.py. Student is required to write a Python script containing a function called factorial(). 
- The function takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial.
